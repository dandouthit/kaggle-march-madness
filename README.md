# kaggle-march-madness
This repository contains code that I used to submit entries to the Kaggle NCAA March Madness contest. I plan to update this every year, creating a new branch with that year's code once the competition is complete.

For the 2018 competition, my entry that utilized just the differences in ELO ratings between teams in a matchup had an average log loss of 0.606138, which would have placed 394th out of 934 entries. However, my entry utilizing ELO rating differences and a rolling average of team stats for the past 10 games was the better entry, placing 257th out of 934.
